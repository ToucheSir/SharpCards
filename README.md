# SharpCards

SharpCards is a desktop app built with C#. It allows the user to create, store, and read two-sided flashcards. 

####The Console Application

Prior to building this program using Windows Forms, we built [a skeleton console application](https://github.com/ryansama/Flashcards-Console-App) to test functionality, data structures and efficiency. 

####Material Design

We are interested in building this desktop app with components of [Google's Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html). A big thanks goes to [Ignace Maes](https://github.com/IgnaceMaes) who created a [Material Design skin for WinForms](https://github.com/IgnaceMaes/MaterialSkin), which we are using in the app.
